## 1.0.1 - 2025-02-25

### Package Distribution Update

In previous releases, Ubuntu packages were available only through the PPA on
Launchpad(ppa:groonga/ppa). Starting with this release, packages are also
distributed via our Groonga APT repository at https://packages.groonga.org.

While the groonga-nginx package itself remains unchanged, the underlying Groonga
dependency is different. Packages from our Groonga APT repository
(https://packages.groonga.org/) include Groonga built with Apache Arrow enabled,
which unlocks extra features such as offline parallel index building.

We will announce how to use Groonga APT repository soon.
